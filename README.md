# What Is a Cryptocurrency Price Tracker?

A cryptocurrency price tracker monitors the current value of different digital currencies and tokens. Many of these services provide historical data as well, allowing users to compare current prices against older values. Some of these services even have a tool that allows users to contrast the performance of multiple cryptocurrencies against one another.
While it may seem obvious, the accuracy of the price tracker that an investor decides to use will have a significant impact on their decisions, as well as on the timing and success of their investments. A tracker that is updated consistently and that uses reliable data in calculating its values is obviously crucial.
